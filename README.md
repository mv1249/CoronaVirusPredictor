# CoronaVirusPredictor
This is a basic Supervised Machine Learning model which predicts whether the patient has tested positive/negative for Corona Virus based on parameters like whether the patient has pneumonia,hypertension or the patient was under intubation etc etc..
i've used Flask and Bootstrap as the FrontEnd,and MachineLearning Model as the backend...
